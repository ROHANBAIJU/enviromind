-**Inspiration**:
The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) inspired us to create a platform that bridges technology and environmental consciousness. In a world increasingly driven by consumption and convenience, we wanted to build a tool that not only raises awareness about sustainable practices but also actively enables responsible behavior through AI and data-driven insights.

-**What it does**:
EnviroMind is an AI-powered platform built to promote sustainability and responsible decision-making. It comprises five main tools:
i.**EcoScan**: Scans product barcodes to analyze their environmental impact and includes a Revive Store where users can buy/sell recyclable goods.
ii.**AgroVision**: Offers a Soil Scanner that classifies soil types and provides key agricultural information. It also detects plant diseases using images and supports a direct farmer-to-consumer marketplace.
iii.**Dr.R**: An interactive AI chatbot that assists users with medical concerns and includes a virtual medical store for purchasing essential medications.
iv.**Madam A**: Provides curated online courses to educate users on the SDGs and sustainable living practices.
v.**PolluMap**: Accepts a city name and displays pollution, water quality, and weather data through interactive maps and charts.

-**How we built it**:
We developed the project using Flask for the backend and integrated Firebase as our real-time database.
For EcoScan and AgroVision, we trained AI models using publicly available datasets from Kaggle to classify soil types and detect plant diseases.
Dr. R was developed as a medical chatbot using natural language processing for interactive health consultations.
PolluMap integrates multiple external APIs to gather environmental data and uses Leaflet.js to provide an interactive map experience.
The frontend was styled with modern web components for a clean, user-friendly experience (created using an internal web design tool).


-**Challenges we ran into**:
Collecting and cleaning high-quality datasets for AI model training.
Ensuring smooth API integration and real-time data synchronization.
Making the AI chatbot conversational yet medically accurate without overstepping ethical boundaries.
Designing a seamless, consistent user experience across five diverse tools.

-**Accomplishments that we're proud of**:
Successfully deploying multiple AI models for real-world applications within a unified platform.
Creating an engaging and functional interface that empowers users to make sustainable choices.
Integrating diverse tools—from environmental scanning to agriculture, healthcare, and education—under a single mission.
Providing real-time environmental data visualization through maps and graphs.

-**What we learned**:
The importance of ethical AI development when dealing with health and environmental data.
How to work collaboratively across different modules (AI, APIs, UI/UX, databases) to build a cohesive platform.
The power of integrating technology with social impact for a more sustainable future.

-**What's next for EnviroMind** :
Expanding EcoScan's product database through crowdsourcing and partnerships with eco-certification bodies.
Enhancing AgroVision with geotagging for regional farming recommendations.
Integrating Dr. R with licensed telemedicine APIs for better medical support.
Adding gamification to Madam A to improve engagement and knowledge retention.
Deploying PolluMap as a mobile-first app with real-time pollution alerts and community-driven reporting.
EnviroMind is not just a project—it's a movement toward conscious living through the power of AI and environmental insights.
